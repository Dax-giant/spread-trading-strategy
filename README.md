Spread Trading Strategy

This repository showcases a pairs trading strategy using stpread trading. The project focuses on identifying and exploiting pricing inefficiencies between two highly correlated assets.


Overview
1. Objective:
  To trade on the spread (price difference) between assets, assuming mean-reversion behavior.
2. Methodology:
  Correlation and Cointegration: Identify long-term relationships between assets.
  Spread Analysis: Define trading signals based on deviations from the spread's historical mean.
  Backtesting: Evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
3. Results:
  The spread-based backtest showed profitability with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.86.
  Applying signals to individual asset prices highlighted practical challenges for implementation.

This strategy demonstrates the potential of spread trading strategy while highlighting areas for refinement in practical applications.
